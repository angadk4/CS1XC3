1,2200,2248,2228,The memory usage for all three algorithms is similar for small inputs like 1.
4,2128,2228,2128,The binary search algorithm uses more memory than the other two algorithms for the input of 4. This may be due to its logarithmic time complexity.
22,2256,2252,2220,The linear search algorithm uses more memory than the other two algorithms for the input of 22. This may be due to its linear time complexity.
37,2128,2264,2264,The binary search and Fibonacci algorithms use more memory than the linear search algorithm for the input of 37. This may be due to their logarithmic time complexity.
22906,2220,2212,2220,The memory usage for all three algorithms is similar for this input.
53757,2232,2304,2228,The binary search algorithm uses more memory than the other two algorithms for the input of 53757. This may be due to its logarithmic time complexity.

996637,2224,2256,2256,The memory usage for all three algorithms is similar for this input.
996639,2260,2244,2248,The memory usage for all three algorithms is similar for this input.
996652,2244,2300,2308,The binary search and Fibonacci algorithms use more memory than the linear search algorithm for the input of 996652. This may be due to their logarithmic time complexity.
-996652,2232,2256,2308,The negative number is an outlier and it is not clear what it represents. However, the binary search and Fibonacci algorithms use more memory than the linear search algorithm for this input, which is consistent with their logarithmic time complexity.
