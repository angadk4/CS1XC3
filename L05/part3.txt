All the reported times are zero because the program was not run for long enough to generate any meaningful data. The -pg flag records data about the program's execution, but it does not output the data until the program terminates normally. Since the factor_itr and factor_rec functions are designed to quickly find the factors of a number, they likely terminate before the profiling data can be output.

It appears that the function "factors_itr" is only being called once per program run because it is only being called once for each input number and mode combination in the loops in the script. 

There may not be an obvious mathematical relationship between the input number and the number of recursive calls, as it depends on the specific prime factors of the input number. However, it is likely that larger numbers with more prime factors will result in more recursive calls, as the algorithm will need to explore more possible combinations of prime factors to find all the factors of the number.
