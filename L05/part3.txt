All the reported times are zero because the program was not run for long enough to generate any reviewable data. Essentially, the -pg flag we included records data about the program's execution, but it does not output the data until the program terminates. Since the factor_itr and factor_rec functions are coded to quickly and efficiently find the factors of a number, they likely terminate long before the profiling data can be outputted.

The factors_itr function is only being called once because it is called inside the main function, which is executed just once when the program is run. Essentially, the function is only being called one time for each input number and mode combination.

There is not any concrete mathematical relationship between the input number and the number of recursive calls, as it will obviously depend on the exact number of prime factors of the inputted number. However, it appears that larger numbers with more prime factors will result in more recursive calls, since the algorithm will need to explore a greater number of possible combinations to find all factors. Therefore, we can say that there is a positive correlation.
