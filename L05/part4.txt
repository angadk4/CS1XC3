a) The iterative and recursive algorithms are similar since they will both calculate the factorial of the input values when run. However, they are different in their approach. The iterative algorithm uses a loop to multiply the numbers whereas the recursive algorithm calls itself again and again until it reaches the base case. The iterative algorithm generally has more repetition because it uses a while loop.

(b) It appears that line 144     for (int j = 0; j < 50; j++) {     is being run the most times. This is likely because the outer loop is being executed many times, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop is also being executed 50 times. This could result in the loop on line 144 being run many times. This line is the same for both recursive and iterative. This is because the way the case statement in main is formatted results in the recursive case being run every time, even when the mode is iterative.

(c) It appears that there are certain lines of code within both types of programs that are not executed. For example, in the Some lines are likely part of the source file such as comments, preprocessor directives, or blank lines.

(d) If we were to try to optimize either function, a good place to start would be to optimize the base case check in the recursive algorithm. This could help to reduce the number of function calls and improve performance. Additionally, for the iterative algorithm, we could try to implement a more efficient multiplication algorithm to further optimize the code.
